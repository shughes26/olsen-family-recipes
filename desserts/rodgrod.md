# Rød Grød  

### Ingredients
- 3 container strawberries
- 3 containers raspberries
- 2 containers blueberries, or cherries
- 1 cup sugar (or more, if berries are tart)
- 12 cups water
- 1 cup potato starch
- 1 cup cold water
- 1 ½ tablespoons vanilla

### Also have handy
- 2 large stew pots
- a lot of cheesecloth


### Method
Clean and de-stem berries. I usually cut the strawberries into quarters, too. Add them to one stewing pot, place the sugar and water into the pot and heat to a boil. Continue simmering until the strawberries are a lot less colorful. Smoosh the blueberries or cherries to ensure you get the bulk of their flavor, too.

Once you have the fruit rendered, it is time to strain the fruit water. You will do this via a colander, strainer or whatever you have, using cheesecloth for the last two strains to ensure you really did get all of the seeds out. (I usually strain three times.) Once you have just fruit-colored water back into one stewing pot place it back onto heat to boil again. 

At this point, take a few tastes and add any additional sugar you feel is needed. While you are waiting for the boil, measure out your 1 cup cold water separately and keep it handy. Then, measure out your potato starch into a bowl. Whisk the potato starch to release any bumpiness. Finally, measure out your 1 ½ tablespoons of vanilla.

Once your fruit water boils again, make sure the stove temperature will hold it at a mild boil and get a large whisk out, you will need it momentarily. Now, add the cold water to your potato starch and whisk with smaller whisk immediately to blend. As soon as that slurry has blended, pour it into the big pot and whisk immediately to make sure it doesn’t thicken in just one spot in the pot. The thickening happens in a hurry. Whisk the thickened Rod Grod for at least a minute at a reasonable boil to cook that starch. Then, you can turn off the heat and blend the vanilla in right at the end. 

Once cool, store in covered containers, refrigerated. Can also make some into popsicles, if you have the gear.
